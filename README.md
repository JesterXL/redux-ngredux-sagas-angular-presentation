# Redux, ngRedux, & Sagas: A Gentle Introduction for Angular Developers

You either have heard of Redux from the React crowd, or perhaps have learned a little functional programming, and are looking how to incorporate it into your Angular 1 and/or Angular 2 applications. Jesse will cover what Redux is, why it's helpful, how it's different from Flux/MobX, and how it's used in an Angular 1.5+ application. He'll also cover to use of Sagas, and how they make dealing with complicated asynchronous actions a lot easier to code if you're used to imperative/OOP languages, as well as testing them. Finally, he'll cover some of the pain points you can run into, refactoring strategies, and tooling setup needed.
